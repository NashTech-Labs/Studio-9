Once the inSilico Platform is established and the initial set of Data Sources identified and connectors made available to Client, subject to Client&rsquo;s timely compliance with its obligations as set forth within this Section 2.1, Knoldus will make the Services generally available to Client (the "<em><strong>Go Live Date</strong></em>"). Client agrees: (a) to cooperate with Knoldus in providing Knoldus with access to the Data Sources and Client Data in order to extract the relevant Client Data and establish a means of regularly extracting such Client Data on an ongoing basis, including installing any connectors provided by Knoldus for the identified Data Sources and to make those Data Sources available to the inSilico Platform; (b) to make reasonably available both Client subject matter experts and subject matter experts in the Client Data Sources; and (c) to make available in a timely manner, all technical documentations, business process and other critical documents that are necessary to aid in Knoldus&rsquo;s performance of the Services.

The Receiving Party will take prompt and appropriate action to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of the Disclosing Party&rsquo;s Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party will not be in violation of this Section 6 with regard to a disclosure that was in response to a valid order or requirement by a court or other governmental body or otherwise required by law, provided that the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior written notice of such disclosure in order to permit the Disclosing Party to seek an appropriate protective order. Information that is disclosed pursuant to a valid court or governmental order shall not lose its status as Confidential Information.</p>
<h2><a>7.</a> OWNERSHIP OF PROPRIETARY ITEMS</h2>
<p><a><strong>7.1</strong></a>&nbsp;<strong>General. </strong>All Proprietary Items provided to or accessed by Client under this Agreement are being made available on a strictly confidential and limited use basis in accordance with this Agreement. This Agreement is not an agreement of sale, and no title, patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, intellectual property or other ownership rights to any Proprietary Items are transferred to Client under this Agreement. Knoldus reserves all rights not expressly granted by this Agreement.</p>
<p><a><strong>7.2</strong></a>&nbsp;<strong>Title and Ownership</strong>. All right, title, and interest in and to the Proprietary Items (including all related patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, intellectual property and other ownership rights) are and will remain the sole and exclusive property of Knoldus. Any derivative works, modifications, or enhancements relating to the Proprietary Items (whether created alone by either Party or jointly by or on behalf of both Parties or their representatives) will be solely and exclusively owned by Knoldus. Client hereby assigns to Knoldus any rights, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights in any feedback, suggestions, ideas, derivative works, modifications, enhancements, or improvements related to the Proprietary Items that Client or any of its authorized users or representatives provide, propose, create, conceive, author or develop relating to this Agreement or their use of the Services or inSilico Platform. Client will execute and deliver (or cause its representatives to execute and deliver) any additional documents deemed reasonably necessary or appropriate to perfect, maintain, protect, or enforce Knoldus&rsquo;s rights described above and the intent of this Section 7.</p>
<p><a><strong>7.3</strong></a>&nbsp;<strong>Custom Dashboards Ownership and License Grants. </strong></p>
<p><a><strong>7.3.1</strong></a>&nbsp;<strong>Knoldus Created Custom Dashboards</strong>.

<p><a><strong>7.3.2</strong></a>&nbsp;<strong>Client Created Custom Dashboards</strong>. If Client creates a dashboard on its own, Client shall own all right and title to such Custom Dashboard; however, Client grants to Knoldus an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty free right and license to use the Custom Dashboard in Knoldus&rsquo;s performance of the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Knoldus may create and make available to its other clients, dashboards that are similar to the Custom Dashboard created by Client, provided that Knoldus does not use any Client Confidential Information in the creation of such other dashboards and Client hereby waives any right it may have to stop Knoldus from creating similar dashboards or seek compensation from Knoldus from the creation of such dashboards and further covenants it shall not sue Knoldus or its other customers for the use of dashboards created by Knoldus without the use of any Client Confidential Information. Client acknowledges and agrees that even though Client retains all right and title to Client-created Custom Dashboards, Knoldus makes no representations or warranties relating to the functionality of the Custom Dashboards after termination or expiration of this Agreement as such Client-created Custom Dashboards were designed to work on the inSilico Platform with Knoldus&rsquo;s proprietary data schemas and workbooks. Client further acknowledges and agrees that the Custom Dashboards may have limited functionality and may not be functional at all after the term, because Client is not granted any rights or license to the underlying data systems or technology that are required for the Custom Dashboards to function.</p>
