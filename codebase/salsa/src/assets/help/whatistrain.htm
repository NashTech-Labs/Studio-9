<p class="MsoNormal">Gives the user their own sandbox environment in which they 
can perform fully automated Machine Learning, where all the processing stages 
involved in Machine Learning (referred to as the Machine Learning Pipeline - 
MLP) and the configuration of parameters needed to drive each stage (these 
configuration parameters are referred to as Hyper-parameters), are automatically 
created and explored by inSilico to find the best configuration of MLP stages 
that ultimately produces the most valid/accurate AI Model).  Cortex also 
gives the user the ability to immediately make Predictions from this newly 
discovered or any pre-existing AI model using any batch of input data as long as 
the data conforms to the input data fields expected by the AI model.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Note: Train currently lives inside of Compose in this 
version. It will be moved to the Train tab in a future version.</i></p>
