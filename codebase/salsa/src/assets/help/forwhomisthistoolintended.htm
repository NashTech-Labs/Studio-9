whom is this tool intended?</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">As our vision is to democratize advanced machine learning and 
AI, this tool is intended to initiate a seismic shift in who can leverage 
advanced modeling from exclusively large, resource rich teams to every 
team.  InSilico was created to enable anyone on a team—but specifically the 
subject matter expert (SME)—to single handedly execute the AI Development Life 
Cycle (ADLC).  By automating and abstracting the highly-technical and 
domain specific knowledge, we allow anyone to use this tool, from the neophyte 
just beginning to dabble in analytics to the advanced guru who wants to develop 
and execute the ADLC faster and more efficiently.</p>
