<h3>Train</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Train is perhaps the most important “operator” in 
Compose.  It allows users to define a Model definition—given by the input 
matrix and the selection of predictor columns and response column.  After 
dragging the table that you want to be the input matrix for your Model, you will 
see a preview of the table in the drag-drop box.  By default, all columns 
are marked as “Ignore”.  Using the dropdown selector for each column, 
select the set of Predictors and one Response column you want.  NOTE: you 
must have at least one Predictor and one and only one Response. By clicking 
Train, the model training has been initiated and a view of counter of elapsed 
time and percent complete will be shown.  At any time during the training 
process, you can review the Model definition by navigating to the Input Table 
tab.  Upon successful completion of the model, the saved model asset will 
appear in Library.  Removing an executed Train step will also delete the 
generated Model. </p>
