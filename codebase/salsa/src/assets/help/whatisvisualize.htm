<p class="MsoNormal">Gives the user a tool to perform Visual Analytics on the AI 
Models and any of the Data available through the user's Library.  An AI 
Model provides a mathematical "formula" that Predicts, Classifies, or finds 
Association Links in information in response to the values of input variables 
(known as Predictor Variables). Corona allows the user to simulate what 
Predictions, Classifications, and/or Associations will be generated by the AI 
Model when the user supplies data for the input variables.  Within Corona, 
the user can combine data from the Predictions/Classifications/Associations with 
any of the other Data contained within their library and create Dashboards, 
Reports, and Ad-Hoc Analyses similar to those provided by the leading Visual 
Analytics tools (with the difference against these leading tools being Corona 
empowers a user to visualize an AI Model, and not just visualize historical 
data).</p>
