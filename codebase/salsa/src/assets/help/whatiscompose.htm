<p class="MsoNormal">Gives the user a visual, spreadsheet-like tool and their own 
sandbox environment in which they can specify a Flow, which is step-by-step 
process for manipulating data contained within any table through data 
transformation operations (this whole process is sometimes referred to as 
Feature Engineering), integrate data scattered across multiple tables, and 
cleanse the data (i.e., perform de-duplication).  Composer automatically 
generates the software code needed to fulfill the step-by-step data 
transformation operations, and will automatically execute this software code on 
a massively parallelized cluster.</p>
